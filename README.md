# Python Graphics - 2021
This is project code using Python OpenGL for several different graphics projects. This code was all made for my undergrad Computer Graphics course. The entry point for each project is Sketch.py The projects are as follows:
1. 2DTriangleFill - Renders triangles and lines based on points you click and interpolates color between points.
2. 3DLighting - Contains several 3D scenes with various objects of different materials. Lights in each scene illuminate objects with ambient, specular, and diffuse lighting properties.
3. FishTank - A 3D environment with small Fish models being chased around by a large Shark model. These actors have behavior to follow/chase each other, as well as collision with the environment.
4. ModelSpider - A 3D model spider composed of several basic mesh objects. Each joint section is posable with realistic pose ranges.
